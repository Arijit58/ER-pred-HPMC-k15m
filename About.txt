In order to predict the ER, the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifier model has been developed. It is a type of artificial neural network used for supervised learning, specifically for classification tasks. It learns from input-output pairs, using a feedforward approach with multiple layers (including an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer) to predict the most probable label for a given input.
